# Hey there! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Chariot Claims](https://www.chariotclaims.com/), where I craft high-performance, scalable software using **AWS serverless technologies**. I’m passionate about building robust systems from the ground up, designing **microservices**, **event-driven architectures**, and **APIs** that solve real-world problems. With a knack for mentoring teams and driving projects from 0 to 1, I thrive on creating sustainable, cutting-edge solutions. I really enjoy working with AI to help me become more efficient and productive. Staying up to date on latest AI technologies is a must for me. I'm relatively tech agnostic, I think its more important to use the best technology to solve that particular problem.
